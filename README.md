## About

This repo intends to restore python code for interview questions(algorithms and such) in terms of classical types of data structures or solutions.

All function code should be able to run through the available or any other reasonable test cases.

## Usage

Simply run python files as scripts.

Python 3.9 are fully supported(actually it's the basis), while other 3.x version should also be compatible(not guaranteed).

## Contributing

There's always something to fix or improve, so [issues](https://github.com/iamgodot/code2077/issues) and pull requests are welcome.
