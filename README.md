This repo maintains a minimal collection of data structure and algorithm interview questions.

## Data Structures

There're 2 ways to classify data structures, either by their logical structure or their physical structure.

For logical structure, linear data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues, while nonlinear ones contain trees, heaps and graphs. In addition, hash tables could be both of them.

For physical structure, which reflects the way data is stored in memory, can be divided into continuous space storage and non-continuous space storage. Therefore, all data structures can be implemented in arrays, linked lists or a combination of both.
